# UI Refinement Implementation Plan

## Overview
Comprehensive UI refinement to make the app coherent and "Agency-first" with 100% real data.

## Status: IN PROGRESS

### ✅ Partial Completion
- Step 0: Shared primitives (badges, constants, partial Agent→Agency rename)
- Step 1: Home page clickability improvements
- Step 3: Component structure created

### 🔄 Remaining Work

Given the comprehensive scope, here's the implementation strategy:

1. **Complete Step 0**: Finish all Agent → Agency renames
2. **Step 2**: Agency page refactor (new components)
3. **Step 3**: Trades page fix (wire dashboard snapshot)
4. **Step 4**: Performance page updates (honest about data)
5. **Step 5**: Journal page enhancement (usable UI)
6. **Step 6**: Library page refactor (memory browser)
7. **Step 7**: Settings enhancements (diagnostics, memory section)

## Implementation Notes

- All components follow design system: rounded-24px, SourceStatusBadge, responsive
- No mock data - show empty states explicitly
- Every card is drill-down (clickable/navigable)
- Agent → Agency rename in UI text only (not filenames)

## Next Steps

Working through each step systematically, committing after logical groups.
